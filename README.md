# WhatsApp Clone
I have created a WhatsApp Clone using React.js as Frontend and Firebase as Backend. A user can use his Google Account to login to this App's Rooms and can message in any of the Rooms and has also the ability to create a New Room. A user can also search for rooms. This project is also Responsive.
